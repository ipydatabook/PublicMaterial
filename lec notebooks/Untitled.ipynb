Calling functions¶The most common way to combine or manipulate values in Python is by calling functions. Python comes with many built-in functions that perform common operations.\\\\nFor example, the abs function takes a single number as its argument and returns the absolute value of that number. Run the next two cells and see if you understand the output.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn\\xa0[8]:\\\\n\\\\n     \\\\nabs(5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n    Out[8]:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn\\xa0[9]:\\\\n\\\\n     \\\\nabs(-5)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n    Out[9]:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4.1. Application: Computing walking distances¶Chunhua is on the corner of 7th Avenue and 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan, and she wants to know far she\\\\'d have to walk to get to Gramercy School on the corner of 10th Avenue and 34th Street.\\\\nShe can\\\\'t cut across blocks diagonally, since there are buildings in the way.  She has to walk along the sidewalks.  Using the map below, she sees she\\\\'d have to walk 3 avenues (long blocks) and 8 streets (short blocks).  In terms of the given numbers, she computed 3 as the difference between 7 and 10, in absolute value, and 8 similarly.\\\\nChunhua also knows that blocks in Manhattan are all about 80m by 274m (avenues are farther apart than streets).  So in total, she\\\\'d have to walk $(80 \\\\\\\\times |42 - 34| + 274 \\\\\\\\times |7 - 10|)$ meters to get to the park.\\\\n\\\\n\""
