    "\n",
    "Chemistry students synthesized three different derivatives of penicillin, and meanwhile other students in a microbiology class grew two different bacteria in petri dishes.  The synthesized derivatives of penicillin are supposed to possess antibacterial qualities, which is to say they act as antibiotics.  To test those qualities, the three derivatives were introduced into the petri dishes, by soaking a small disk of paper in the antibiotic then placing the disk in the petri dish.  The \"zone of inhibition\" is the circular region around the disk where the bacteria was not able to grow.  (This is also known as a Kirby-Bauer test.)  The diameters of these zones of inhibition were measured in decimeters and recorded, the data is available below.  The larger the zone of inhibition the more effective the antibiotic.    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Of the two bacteria, was one of the derivatives more effective than penicillin?  Or ampicillin?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Was the 5 parts per million or the 10 parts per million more effective?  (Parts per million will be abbreviated to ppm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Was any derivative more effective against the gram positive bacteria (*S. epidermidis*) or the the gram negative bacteria (*E. coli*)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If one compound is effective against *E. coli* is it likely to be effective against *S. epidermidis*?"
