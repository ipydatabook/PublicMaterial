    "\n",
    "Punishment for crime has many [philosophical justifications](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/punishment/#ThePun).  An important one is that fear of punishment may *deter* people from committing crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, some jurisdictions execute people who are convicted of particularly serious crimes, such as murder.  This punishment is called the *death penalty* or *capital punishment*.  The death penalty is controversial, and deterrence has been one focal point of the debate.  There are other reasons to support or oppose the death penalty, but in this project we'll focus on deterrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question about deterrence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Through our exploration, does instituting a death penalty for murder actually reduce the number of murders?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have a strong intuition in one direction, but the evidence turns out to be surprisingly complex.  Different sides have variously argued that the death penalty has no deterrent effect and that each execution prevents 8 murders, all using statistical arguments!  We'll try to come to our own conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main data source for this lab comes from a [paper](http://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf) by three researchers, Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, and Shepherd.  The dataset contains rates of various violent crimes for every year 1960-2003 (44 years) in every US state.  The researchers compiled the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{murder rate for state X in year Y} = \\frac{\\text{number of murders in state X in year Y}}{\\text{population in state X in year Y}}*100000$$\n",

    "Did banning the death penalty *cause* the murder rates to rise?  Probably not, and that's not the claim being made here.  If we look more closely at the average murder rate for the nation, we see the murder rate started to increase in 1962 and continued to increase until 1974.  So the murder rate started to increase years before the death penalty was banned and continued to increase for several years after the ban.  The implication is that since the rates were already increasing before the ban, it's unlikely that the 1972 ban on the death penalty caused the increase from 1971 to 1973.  "
