    "\n",
    "TT was a popular technique used throughout the 20th century that was toted as a great way to bring balance to a person's health. Certain practitioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals.\n",

Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
