    "\n",
    "TT was a popular technique used throughout the 20th century that was toted as a great way to bring balance to a person's health. Certain practitioners claim they have the ability to feel the HEF and can massage it in order to promote health and relaxation in individuals.\n",

    "[Emily Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Rosa) was a 4th grade student who was very familiar with the world of TT, thanks to her parents, who were both medical practitioners and skeptics of TT.\n",
    "\n",
    "For her 4th grade science fair project, Emily decided to test whether or not TT practitioners could truly interact with a person's HEF. She later went on to publish her work in TT, becoming the youngest person to have a research paper published in a peer reviewed medical journal."

    "\n",
    "Emily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practicioners' guesses were random, like the flip of a coin. Imagine that she did not believe that the TT practicioners were really able to sense a HEF and she wanted to prove that they did *worse* than simple random guessing.  \n",
