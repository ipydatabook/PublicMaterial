The FHFA HPI incorporates tens of millions of home sales and offers insights about house price fluctuations at the national, census division, state, metro area, county, ZIP code, and census tract levels.  FHFA uses a fully transparent methodology based upon a weighted, repeat-sales statistical technique to analyze house price transaction data.   \n",
    "The FHFA HPI is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. The FHFA HPI is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings on the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HIP dataset we're using was downloaded from [here](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx) in September, 2021.  Since the FHFA updates this website frequently, if you were to obtain a fresh dataset when you're reading this it will most likely contain new data.  (Because this data is not based on literally every house that is bough/sold, but just some, we should consider this a sample.)"
